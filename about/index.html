<p>This is the main site for the Rhode Island Ruby User Group. The RIRUG was started in August of 2008 with the goal of providing a solid user group for the citizens of Rhode Island. Boston.rb is a great group, but we wanted start our own user group here in the Ocean State to highlight the local talent in our area.</p>
