Join us at the MojoTech ([@mojotech](https://twitter.com/mojotech)) Providence office from 6-8 PM on Tuesday, April 3, 2018 (we need the year in here, right?).  Joe Alba ([@joealba](https://twitter.com/joealba)) will talk about some highlights from RubyConf 2017 in New Orleans, and we'll be joined by John Sawers ([@johnksawers](https://twitter.com/johnksawers)) to talk about integrating with a new API -- the Emotional API.

> "Being a good developer isn't just about slinging code; we're part of a community. Interacting with others in a community means feelings are involved. But feelings are messy and uncomfortable, so why can't you just ignore them? Because emotional skills are critical for working well on a team, and for writing code every day. In this talk youâ€™ll learn how emotions are affecting you by modeling them as an API and looking at the code."

Also, PVD's own Ryan Laughlin ([@rofreg](https://twitter.com/rofreg)) will introduce us to his Checkup concept that he's been using at Splitwise -- a way to run tests every X minutes and detect errors against a _production_ environment.
